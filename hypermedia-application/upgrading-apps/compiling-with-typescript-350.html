<h1>Compiling With Typescript 3.5.0</h1>
<p>Apps may have problems compiling with Typescript 3.5.0 and above. You will get an error similar to error TS2304: Cannot find name &#39;Iterable&#39;. This is because Typescript is no longer able to find the iterable library by default.</p>
<p>To fix this add <code>&quot;es2015.iterable&quot;</code> to the <strong>&quot;lib&quot;</strong> array in your tsconfig.json file. When you are done it should look something like the following:</p>
<p><code>&quot;lib&quot;: [
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;dom&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;es5&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;es2015.promise&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;es2015.iterable&quot;
	<br />],</code></p>
<p>The Typescript build should now work correctly.</p>
