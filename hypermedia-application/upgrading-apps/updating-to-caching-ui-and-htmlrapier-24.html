<h1>Updating to Caching UI and HtmlRapier 24</h1>
<p>The Caching Ui will attempt to cache as much ui as possible on the client side. This allows pages to load much faster since they only load a small loader page with the links to the scripts to embed the rest of the ui, which should be cached on the client side already. If any changes are made the loader page will send new links busting the cache of the old ui. In addition this upgrade will embed the user&#39;s entry point in the loader page as well saving a request to the server.</p>
