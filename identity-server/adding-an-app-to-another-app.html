<h1>Adding an App to Another App</h1>
<p>Once Client Credentials are setup you can add those clients as users to other applications. This allows apps to connect to each other.</p>
<p>Go to your app&#39;s Edit Users page and click add. Search for your app&#39;s client id using the User Name field.</p>

<p>Find the application you were looking for and click Edit Roles.</p>
<p>Finally set the permissions you want the applicaiton to be able to perform. Using this you can limit what different clients are able to do. In the screenshot we have limited the application users coming in to only be able to edit values.</p>
